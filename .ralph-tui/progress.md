# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks progress across iterations. Agents update this file
after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.

## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)

- **BASE_URL env var pattern**: Use `os.environ.get("BASE_URL", "").rstrip("/") or str(request.base_url).rstrip("/")` for canonical URL generation. Already used in Twilio webhooks and room creation.
- **Jest invocation**: Must use `node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/.bin/jest` (not `npx jest --experimental-vm-modules`).
- **TestClient fixtures**: `room_client` fixture injects fakeredis-backed RoomManager. Use `monkeypatch` for env var tests.
- **LLM endpoint retry pattern**: `llm_command()` uses a for-loop retry (2 attempts), catching all exceptions from provider functions. On double failure, returns `{"plan": [...], "fallback": true}` with random commands. Frontend checks `fallback` flag for toast display.
- **LLM provider mocking**: Patch `server._llm_anthropic` or `server._llm_openai` (AsyncMock) — the `_call_llm_provider` wrapper delegates to these.
- **Leaderboard mock fixture**: `lb_client` fixture uses `MagicMock` + `AsyncMock` for EloManager methods. Useful for testing endpoint validation without a real PostgreSQL connection.
- **INPUT_MODES flag pattern**: Add boolean flags (e.g., `p1Only`, `p2Disabled`, `mpDisabled`) to `INPUT_MODES` entries in `ui.js` — all UI, keyboard nav, and click handlers check these flags to exclude modes per-player or per-screen-context.
- **MP controller validation**: `VALID_MP_CONTROLLERS` (server.py) is a strict subset of `VALID_CONTROLLERS` — use it in MP endpoints (`room_controller`). Matchmaking already rejects bot controllers via `controller_to_category() → None`.
- **Server-authoritative timer pattern**: Use `asyncio.create_task()` with module-level `dict[str, asyncio.Task]` for per-room async timers. Timer tasks check room state on wake (idempotent) and clean up their own dict entry. Cancel via `task.cancel()` and `dict.pop()`. Used for controller wait/forfeit timer.
- **Room state transitions**: `selecting → finished` is valid (controller wait forfeit). Existing: `waiting → selecting → fighting → finished`.
- **PKCE auth mocking pattern**: When testing `exchange_code` directly, use `MagicMock` for the httpx response (`.json()` is sync) but `AsyncMock` for the client itself (`.post()` is async). The `@patch("auth.httpx.AsyncClient")` + `@pytest.mark.asyncio` combo is required.
- **Client-side route pattern**: For post-auth redirects, add server route serving `index.html` (e.g. `/multiplayer`), register in `router.js` `parseRoute()`, and handle in `initAuth`'s route dispatch.
- **Special move / projectile pattern**: Define separate `*_DATA` const (not in `ATTACK_DATA`/`ATTACK_ACTIONS`) for special moves. Fighter emits a fire event during its attack frames; Game listens and spawns a Projectile entity. Override `getAttackHitbox()` to return null for the special move (no melee hitbox). Projectile collision is handled in Game's `_updateProjectiles()` with its own damage/stun values.

## 2026-03-14 - stick-fighter-j3r.5
- Removed P2 keyboard option in classic (single-player) mode
- Added `p2Disabled: true` flag to keyboard entry in `INPUT_MODES`
- `updateModeSelection` now dims and disables both `p1Only` and `p2Disabled` pills
- Init guard bumps saved P2 mode from keyboard to simulated (idx 3)
- Keyboard nav (ArrowLeft/Right) skips `p2Disabled` modes for P2
- Click handler also rejects `p2Disabled` clicks for P2
- Files changed:
  - `src/ui.js` — Added `p2Disabled: true` to keyboard INPUT_MODE; updated pill disable condition in `updateModeSelection`
  - `src/main.js` — Updated init guard, keyboard nav skip conditions, click handler guard
  - `tests/ui.test.js` — New test file (6 tests: flag exists, non-keyboard modes clean, valid P2 modes, P1 unaffected, keyboard nav skip, init guard)
- **Learnings:**
  - The `p1Only` pattern was already well-established — `p2Disabled` follows the exact same pattern in reverse
  - `updateModeSelection` sets `pointerEvents: 'none'` which makes pills unclickable, but the click handler still needs a guard for programmatic/keyboard-triggered mode changes
  - Minimal DOM stubs (`globalThis.document` with `createElement`) are sufficient to import `ui.js` in node test environment without jsdom
  - All quality gates: 432 Python tests, ruff, mypy, 93 JS tests pass
---

## 2026-03-14 - stick-fighter-j3r.6
- Split leaderboard into distinct Voice League and Keyboard League tabs
- Removed the merged "All" view — `category=all` now returns 400
- Frontend defaults to the league matching the player's most recent controller (or voice if unknown)
- Files changed:
  - `server.py` — Removed `category=all` merge logic from `/api/leaderboard`, default changed to `voice`, error message updated
  - `index.html` — Removed "All" filter button, renamed tabs to "Voice League" / "Keyboard League"
  - `src/main.js` — Added `defaultLeaderboardCategory()` function that reads `sf_p1Mode` from localStorage, changed default from `'all'` to dynamic category
  - `tests/test_server.py` — Added `lb_client` fixture with mocked EloManager; added `TestLeaderboardEndpoint` class (7 tests: all returns 400, invalid returns 400, voice/keyboard returns 200, default is voice, viewer included when ranked, 503 without manager)
- **Learnings:**
  - The backend already tracked ELO separately per category — the "All" view was computed on-the-fly by merging both leaderboards. Removing it was purely subtractive on the server side.
  - `MagicMock` with `AsyncMock` methods works well for testing Litestar endpoints that call async database methods, avoiding the need for a real PostgreSQL connection in unit tests.
  - `mypy` flags `server.elo_manager.some_method = AsyncMock(...)` as `method-assign` + `union-attr` — work around by assigning to a local variable with an assert-not-None guard.
  - All quality gates: 432 Python tests, ruff, mypy, 87 JS tests pass
---

## 2026-03-14 - stick-fighter-j3r.2
- Fixed room share URL to use `BASE_URL` env var instead of `request.base_url`
- Falls back to request Host header when `BASE_URL` is not set
- Files changed:
  - `server.py` — 1 line changed in `room_create()` endpoint (line 640)
  - `tests/test_server.py` — 3 new tests added to `TestRoomCreate`
- **Learnings:**
  - The `BASE_URL` env var was already used for Twilio webhooks in the same file — just wasn't wired into room creation
  - Frontend copy-to-clipboard simply uses the `url` field from the API response, so fixing the backend was sufficient
  - All quality gates: 421 Python tests, ruff, mypy, 81 JS tests pass
---

## 2026-03-14 - stick-fighter-j3r.1
- Fixed LLM fighter regression: silent failure loop when API is unavailable
- Added retry-once with 3s timeout on server-side LLM calls
- On double failure, server returns random commands with `fallback: true` flag
- Client-side fallback generates random plan when server is unreachable
- Toast indicator ("AI connection lost") shown on canvas near player's controller
- Files changed:
  - `server.py` — Refactored `llm_command()` into retry loop + `_call_llm_provider()`, `_parse_llm_plan()`, `_generate_random_plan()`, `FALLBACK_COMMANDS`; reduced httpx timeout from 10s to 3s
  - `src/llm.js` — Added `FALLBACK_COMMANDS`, `_generateFallbackPlan()`, `_setToast()`, `_applyPlan()`; removed `_sleep()`; added `_consecutiveFailures` tracking
  - `src/game.js` — Added `p1LlmToast`/`p2LlmToast` properties, `_drawLlmToast()` method, toast countdown in `_update()`
  - `tests/test_characters.py` — Added `TestLLMCommandRetryAndFallback` (4 tests: success, retry, fallback, openai fallback)
  - `tests/characters.test.js` — Added "LLMAdapter retry and fallback" describe block (6 tests: success, server fallback flag, network error, HTTP error, recovery, plan generation)
- **Learnings:**
  - The "regression" was a silent failure loop — no code bug per se, but missing resilience. When API fails, adapter retried infinitely with no visible feedback.
  - httpx timeout changed from 10s to 3s; this is aggressive for LLM calls but matches PRD spec. The retry provides a second chance.
  - Litestar `@post` returns 201 by default (not 200) — tests must assert `status_code == 201`
  - All quality gates: 425 Python tests, ruff, mypy, 87 JS tests pass
---

## 2026-03-14 - stick-fighter-j3r.3
- Restricted MP controller selection to keyboard, voice, and phone only
- Added `mpDisabled: true` flag to simulated and LLM entries in `INPUT_MODES`
- Room controller and matchmaking screens hide mpDisabled pills (`display: none`) and reject clicks
- Server-side validation: added `VALID_MP_CONTROLLERS` set, `room_controller()` rejects simulated/LLM with 400
- Single-player mode (onboarding) unaffected — still shows all 5 modes
- Files changed:
  - `src/ui.js` — Added `mpDisabled: true` to simulated and LLM INPUT_MODES entries
  - `src/main.js` — Updated `updateRoomControllerUI()`, `updateMatchmakingControllerUI()`, and their click handlers to hide/reject mpDisabled modes
  - `server.py` — Added `VALID_MP_CONTROLLERS` set; added mp-specific validation in `room_controller()`
  - `tests/test_server.py` — Renamed `test_all_valid_controllers_accepted` → `test_all_valid_mp_controllers_accepted`; added `test_simulated_rejected_in_mp` and `test_llm_rejected_in_mp`
  - `tests/ui.test.js` — Added 5 tests in new `INPUT_MODES MP controller restriction` describe block
- **Learnings:**
  - The `mpDisabled` flag is a screen-context flag (unlike `p1Only`/`p2Disabled` which are player-context flags) — same pattern, different axis
  - Matchmaking already had implicit server-side rejection via `controller_to_category()` returning None; room_controller was the gap
  - Using `display: none` (vs opacity 0.3) since AC says "hidden" — cleaner UX than showing disabled options the player can't use
  - All quality gates: 434 Python tests, ruff, mypy, 98 JS tests pass

## 2026-03-14 - stick-fighter-j3r.4
- Implemented controller-select-then-wait flow with 60s server-authoritative forfeit timer
- After confirming controller, player enters "waitingInArena" state: canvas shows their fighter idle, ghost silhouette for opponent, pulsing "Waiting for opponent..." text, and 60s countdown
- Server starts asyncio forfeit timer when first controller is set; cancels when second player confirms
- If timer expires: server transitions room `selecting → finished`, stores `forfeit_winner` in Redis
- Frontend polls room status, detects `finished` + `forfeitWinner`, shows result screen with "OPPONENT FORFEITED"
- If opponent confirms in time: transition to real multiplayer fight (3-2-1-FIGHT)
- Files changed:
  - `room_manager.py` — Added `"finished"` to valid transitions from `"selecting"`
  - `server.py` — Added `CONTROLLER_WAIT_TIMEOUT`, `_controller_wait_tasks` dict, `_controller_wait_timer()` asyncio task, `_start_controller_wait_timer()`, `_cancel_controller_wait_timer()`; updated `room_controller()` to start/cancel timer; updated `room_status()` to include `controllerWaitDeadline` and `forfeitWinner`; updated `room_rematch()` to clear timer/deadline
  - `src/main.js` — Added `startWaitingInArena()` (canvas render loop with Fighter, ghost, countdown), `stopWaitingInArena()`, `handleControllerForfeit()`; updated `handleRoomStatusUpdate()` to handle `waitingInArena` → `fighting` and `waitingInArena` → `finished` transitions; updated controller confirm handler to enter waiting state when `!bothReady`
  - `tests/test_room_manager.py` — Added `test_selecting_to_finished_forfeit` to `TestTransitionStatus`
  - `tests/test_server.py` — Added `test_first_controller_returns_wait_deadline`, `test_both_controllers_clears_deadline` to `TestRoomController`; added `TestControllerWaitForfeit` class (3 tests: deadline in status, forfeit winner in status, no forfeit by default)
  - `tests/waiting-arena.test.js` — New file (9 tests: state transitions, countdown computation, forfeit result determination)
- **Learnings:**
  - The `room` dict from `set_controller()` doesn't include fields set directly via `hset` after the call — use a local variable for the response instead of `room.get()`
  - `asyncio.create_task()` tasks need idempotent guards: check room status on wake since state may have changed while sleeping
  - The `selecting → finished` transition required updating `_VALID_TRANSITIONS` in room_manager.py — easy to miss since the test for invalid transitions would catch attempts to use it otherwise
  - Canvas rendering in the waiting state reuses `Fighter.draw()` directly with a standalone Fighter instance — no need for a full Game object
  - All quality gates: 440 Python tests, ruff, mypy, 109 JS tests pass

## 2026-03-14 - stick-fighter-j3r.8
- Added status feedback for all async operations (US-006)
- Room creation: "Create Room" button shows "Creating..." with pulsing loading state during API call
- Room join: "JOIN" button shows "JOINING..." with loading state; restores on error
- Controller confirm: button shows "Confirming..." during API call, then "CONFIRMED" on success
- Matchmaking search: button shows "SEARCHING..." during join API call; "MATCH FOUND!" flash with scale animation before transitioning to fight
- LLM thinking: subtle pulsing "AI thinking..." indicator on canvas while LLM adapter requests a plan; suppressed when error toast is active
- Files changed:
  - `index.html` — Added `.loading` CSS class for buttons (pulse animation + pointer-events:none), `.mm-match-found` class with scale-in keyframe animation
  - `src/main.js` — Added loading states to room create, room join, controller confirm, matchmaking search handlers; added "Match found!" flash with 1.2s delay in `handleMatchFound()`
  - `src/llm.js` — Added `_setThinking()` method; `_requestPlan()` sets thinking=true on entry, false on all exit paths (success, fallback, error, early return)
  - `src/game.js` — Added `p1LlmThinking`/`p2LlmThinking` boolean properties, `_drawLlmThinking()` method with pulsing opacity; drawn only when no error toast is active
  - `tests/status-feedback.test.js` — New file (10 tests: thinking set/cleared on success/fallback/error/HTTP error/null state, correct player key, suppressed by toast, shows without toast)
- **Learnings:**
  - The existing `pulse` CSS keyframe animation (`0%→50%→100%` opacity) is reusable for loading button states — just add `pointer-events: none` to prevent double-clicks
  - Using a separate boolean (`p1LlmThinking`) rather than reusing the timed toast for "thinking" state is cleaner — the toast timer would need constant refreshing, while the boolean is just set/cleared
  - Button text restoration in `finally` blocks ensures consistent UI state even on error paths — important for the join button where `disabled` state also depends on input length
  - All quality gates: 440 Python tests, ruff, mypy, 119 JS tests pass

## 2026-03-14 - stick-fighter-j3r.10
- Implemented mandatory PKCE authentication for multiplayer via id.dx.deepgram.com
- Updated auth.py: `exchange_code()` accepts optional `code_verifier`, `client_secret` only sent when non-empty, default token endpoint changed from `/oauth/token` to `/token` per dx-id discovery
- Updated server.py: `/api/auth/config` now returns `tokenEndpoint`, `/api/auth/token` forwards `code_verifier`, added `/multiplayer` route for post-auth redirect
- Updated src/auth.js: PKCE flow with `_generateCodeVerifier()` (64-char hex), `_computeCodeChallenge()` (SHA-256 + base64url), verifier stored in sessionStorage, `login()` accepts `returnPath` for post-auth navigation
- Updated src/main.js: multiplayer button checks `isLoggedIn()`, redirects to OIDC provider with `login('/multiplayer')` if not authenticated, `initAuth` handles `/multiplayer` return path
- Updated src/router.js: added `/multiplayer` route type
- Registered `stick-fighter` OIDC client in dx-id seed data (client_id: `stick-fighter`, redirect_uris: localhost:3000 + fight.dx.deepgram.com, token_endpoint_auth_method: `none`)
- `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` is now optional — not needed for PKCE public clients
- Single-player mode remains accessible without authentication
- Files changed:
  - `auth.py` — PKCE code_verifier support, optional client_secret, /token default
  - `server.py` — tokenEndpoint in config, code_verifier forwarding, /multiplayer route
  - `src/auth.js` — Full rewrite with PKCE verifier/challenge generation, returnPath support
  - `src/main.js` — Auth gate on multiplayer button, /multiplayer route handling in initAuth
  - `src/router.js` — Added /multiplayer route detection
  - `tests/test_auth.py` — 32 tests (5 new: code_verifier forwarding, PKCE exchange, secret-only exchange, multiplayer route, token endpoint default fix)
  - `tests/auth.test.js` — 12 tests (7 new: multiplayer route, PKCE verifier generation, challenge computation)
  - `dx-id/apps/id/src/db/seed.ts` — Added stick-fighter OIDC client registration
- **Learnings:**
  - httpx `resp.json()` is synchronous — use `MagicMock` not `AsyncMock` for response objects when testing `exchange_code` directly
  - PKCE `code_challenge` requires base64url encoding: replace `+` with `-`, `/` with `_`, strip `=` padding — standard base64 won't work
  - `history.replaceState` changes the URL without reloading, so post-callback routing must check `window.location.pathname` and dispatch to the right screen
  - The `returnPath` pattern (stored in sessionStorage before redirect, read after callback) is cleaner than query params for post-auth navigation since it survives the OIDC redirect chain
  - All quality gates: 444 Python tests, ruff, mypy, 126 JS tests pass
---

## 2026-03-14 - stick-fighter-j3r.11
- Implemented random fighter username generation for first-time authenticated players
- On first login (no existing name in `players` table), a random username is generated in format `{adjective}-{fighter}-{stick}` or `{fighter}-{stick}`
- Username is checked for uniqueness against `players` table (retry up to 10 times on collision)
- Username stored via `set_player_name()` and returned in auth token response, overriding the OIDC provider's name claim
- Subsequent logins return the same stored username (idempotent)
- Files changed:
  - `elo.py` — Added `FIGHTER_NOUNS`, `STICK_NOUNS`, `ADJECTIVES` word lists, `generate_fighter_username()` function, `EloManager._is_name_taken()` and `EloManager.ensure_fighter_username()` methods
  - `server.py` — Updated `auth_token()` to call `elo_manager.ensure_fighter_username()` when user has an ID and elo_manager is available
  - `tests/test_elo.py` — Added `TestGenerateFighterUsername` (5 tests: format, two-part, three-part, word lists, randomness) and `TestEnsureFighterUsername` (5 tests: new player, existing name, stored, idempotent, unique)
  - `tests/test_auth.py` — Added 2 tests (`test_token_exchange_generates_fighter_username`, `test_token_exchange_without_elo_manager_uses_oidc_name`); updated `test_token_exchange_success` to isolate from username generation
- **Learnings:**
  - The app lifespan creates `elo_manager` when Postgres is available, meaning existing auth tests that didn't mock it now hit the real DB. Tests that assert OIDC name directly need `server.elo_manager = None` to isolate.
  - `_is_name_taken()` is a simple SELECT query — no need for UNIQUE constraint on the `name` column since usernames can be updated manually later
  - With 3,120 total combinations (2,880 three-word + 240 two-word), collision probability is low but non-zero at scale. The retry+fallback approach handles this gracefully.
  - All quality gates: 456 Python tests, ruff, mypy, 126 JS tests pass
---

## 2026-03-14 - stick-fighter-j3r.13
- Implemented Hadouken special move: energy projectile that travels across the stage
- New `HADOUKEN` action in Actions enum (JS + Python)
- Voice/phone trigger: saying "hadouken" or "fireball" via CommandAdapter
- Keyboard trigger: forward-forward-heavy_punch combo within 500ms (KeyboardAdapter combo buffer)
- LLM fighters can include "hadouken" in their 5-move plans (added to system prompt + fallback commands)
- Fighter enters hadouken windup state (~300ms, arms thrust forward skeleton pose)
- Projectile spawns at fighter's hands, travels at 500px/s horizontally
- Projectile rendered as animated energy ball with DG brand colors (radial gradient, trailing glow)
- 25 damage on hit, 16 frames hitstun, blockable (10 frames blockstun), jumpable (mid-height hitbox)
- 1.5s cooldown, one active projectile per player
- Projectile disappears on hit or stage edge
- Python game_engine mirrors all projectile physics, hitbox, and cooldown for server-authoritative MP
- Files changed:
  - `src/input.js` — HADOUKEN action, COMMAND_VOCAB entries (hadouken/fireball/energy blast), KeyboardAdapter combo buffer
  - `src/fighter.js` — HADOUKEN_DATA, hadoukenCooldown, _skeletonHadouken, getAttackHitbox/getAttackData overrides, snapshot fields
  - `src/game.js` — Projectile constants, projectiles array, _handleProjectileSpawn, _updateProjectiles, _drawProjectile, SFX dispatch
  - `src/sfx.js` — hadouken_charge and hadouken_fire SFX categories
  - `src/llm.js` — hadouken in FALLBACK_COMMANDS
  - `game_engine/actions.py` — HADOUKEN action, HADOUKEN_DATA, HADOUKEN_COOLDOWN
  - `game_engine/fighter.py` — hadouken_cooldown, update logic, _skeleton_hadouken, hitbox overrides
  - `game_engine/game.py` — Projectile dataclass, _handle_projectile_spawn, _update_projectiles
  - `game_engine/__init__.py` — Export HADOUKEN_DATA, HADOUKEN_COOLDOWN, Projectile
  - `server.py` — hadouken in LLM_FIGHTER_SYSTEM prompt + FALLBACK_COMMANDS
  - `tests/test_game_engine.py` — TestHadoukenFighter (14 tests) + TestHadoukenProjectile (9 tests)
  - `tests/hadouken.test.js` — Actions, COMMAND_VOCAB, KeyboardAdapter combo, LLM fallback tests (14 tests)
- **Learnings:**
  - Separating HADOUKEN_DATA from ATTACK_DATA prevents it from being triggered by the normal attack input loop, which iterates `ATTACK_ACTIONS`. The special move needs its own priority check before normal attacks.
  - The Fighter→Game event pattern (emit "hadouken:fire", Game picks up and spawns Projectile) keeps concerns separated — Fighter owns the windup animation, Game owns entity lifecycle.
  - The `updateImpactTracking` method also references ATTACK_DATA, so HADOUKEN handling was needed there too (easy to miss since it's called from Game, not Fighter.update directly).
  - Projectile Y position (~159px world) means fighters need feet at y < 147 to dodge, which requires being near jump peak (~107px above floor). The dodge window is ~0.25s — tight but fair.
  - MyPy catches int/float inference conflicts in skeleton methods when the same variable is assigned int in one branch and float in another (use `float()` cast or `10.0` literal).
  - All quality gates: 479 Python tests, ruff, mypy, 140 JS tests pass
